## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!
The project is a part of **Google Data Analytics Certification course capstone**. The scenario involves analysis of the trip data of Cyclistic bike share company.
The company has two models for availing service: individual passes which are called "casual" riders and annual subscriptions called "member" riders.
The company operates in Chicago with around 6000 bicycles at 700 stations.

Maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth as it ensures financial sustainability and customer retention. The insights can help devise effective marketing strategies aimed to convert more casual riders into annual members.

## Business Task

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently ?

> **Objective** : To clean, analyze and visualize the data to observe how casual riders use the bike rentals differently from annual member riders. 
## Data

* **Data source** : Public data from Motivate International Inc. (Divvy Bicycle Sharing Service from Chicago) under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
* [Cyclistic’s historical trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) (2013 onwards) available in `.csv` format. 
* **Our date range** : April 2020 to April 2021 (608 MB data)
* The dataset has individual ride records consisting of ride start-end date & time, station information, bike type, rider type (casual/member).
* Data uploaded to Google Cloud Storage(GCS) in order to import the large files.

## Processing and Cleaning

* Data imported from GCS into **RStudio** for manipulation and analysis using R.
* Visualizations to be developed in **Tableau**.
* `3,284,237` rows were returned but required cleaning.

* **Cleaning process** :

## Analysis and Viz

Check this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/interactivevizualization/TotalRideshare?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to get acceess for interactive Tableau vizualization. 
The final dataset containing trip data of roughly 3.3 million ride records was analyzed. 
Visualizations were developed in Tableau to observe differential trends between the usage by casual riders and annual members.  


#### **Insights**
* 58.95% of total rides (3.3M) were taken by annual members.
* 41.05% of total rides were taken by casual riders.
* Annual members form the majority of business for the company and maximizing on this number should be the focus in the long run.


### Weekly distribution of number of rides
#### **Insights**
* Clearly, the rides taken by casual riders __peak__ throughout the __weekend__ as compared to that of annual members which remains relatively flat. 
* About __50% less__ casual riders use the rentals during weekdays as compared to weekends.  
* This indicates that casual riders use the bike rentals for leisure purposes and not for commuting.     


### Weekly distribution of average ride duration
#### **Insights**
* The average ride duration of casual members is  about __3 times__ that of annual members.
* The average ride duration both type of riders increase on weekends.
* Again, this indicates that casual riders use the bike rentals for leisure purposes.  


### Ride duration vs Ride distance
#### **Insights**
* The plots clearly show the contrast between average ride duration and average ride distance  for both user types. 
* While both user types ride a __similar average distance__, casual riders ride for __3x longer duration__ as compared to annual members.     


### Hourly distribution of number of rides
#### **Insights**
* The proportion of casual riders increases in the non-commuting hours i.e. in forenoon hours and after 8pm from __18%__ of total riders to __50%__ of total riders.
* Annual members take the major chunk of the rides during peak-travel hours in the morning and evening to upto __82%__ of total riders. 
* Again, this indicates that casual riders use the bike rentals for leisure purposes while annual members use it for commuting.  


### Monthly distribution of number of rides - Seasonality 
#### **Insights**
* The proportion of casual riders __falls__ drastically during winter months(Dec-Feb) to only about __20%__ of total riders.
* The proportion of casual riders goes __maximum__ in the months of June, July, August and September to upto __40%__ of total riders.  


## Conclusion and Recommendations

* A common observation is that __casual riders__ are using the bike rentals for __leisure and tourism__ purposes while __annual members__ use it predominantly for __commuting__ purposes.
* Discounting campaigns for casual riders on weekdays can motivate them to use the service for commuting. 
* Tools like push notifications can be used to attract casual riders during the lean periods of the day.
* A campaign for the winter months, maybe clubbed with holidays or Christmas can help pick up the numbers during those months.
